An easy way to add common finders to your Rails controllers.

== Installation

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)
  sudo gem install pelargir-finder_filter

== Usage

finder_filter is intended to replace one-off before filters that you might
commonly write in your Rails controllers. For example:

  class UsersController < ActionController::Base
    before_filter :find_user, :only => [:show, :edit]
    
    def show
      # do something with @user
    end
    
    def edit
      # do something with @user
    end
    
    def find_user
      @user = User.find(params[:id)
    end
  end

finder_filter reduces this pattern to a single line:

  class UsersController < ActionController::Base
    finder_filter :user, :only => [:show, :edit]
    
    def show; end
    def edit; end
  end

To find based on a column other than ID:

  finder_filter :user, :by => :name
    # equivalent to:
    #   @user = User.find_by_name(params[:id])

To find based on a param other than ID:

  finder_filter :user, :param => :permalink
    # equivalent to:
    #   @user = User.find(params[:permalink])

The standard Rails :only and :except options can also be used:

  before_filter :find_user, :only => [:show, :edit]
  before_filter :find_user, :except => [:index]
